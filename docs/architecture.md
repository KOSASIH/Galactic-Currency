# Galactic Currency Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The Galactic Currency system is designed to provide a decentralized cryptocurrency platform that ensures secure, fast, and efficient transactions. This document outlines the key components of the system architecture.

## Components

### 1. Blockchain
The core of the Galactic Currency system is the blockchain, which maintains a distributed ledger of all transactions. It employs a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to validate transactions and secure the network.

### 2. Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They enable automated transactions and governance mechanisms within the Galactic Currency ecosystem.

### 3. Wallet
The wallet component allows users to manage their Galactic Currency, including sending, receiving, and storing coins securely. It includes key management features to ensure the safety of private keys.

### 4. Networking
The networking layer facilitates peer-to-peer communication between nodes in the Galactic Currency network. It uses a custom protocol for transaction propagation and block synchronization.

### 5. Microservices
The system includes several microservices that provide additional functionalities, such as currency exchange and transaction notifications. These services communicate with the core blockchain and wallet components.
